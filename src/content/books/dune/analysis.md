# p. 54 — One Moment, A Whole Life

**Page reference:** p. 54

The ending hits because it doesn’t pretend the narrator “wins” or “loses.” Instead, it reframes the question: what counts as a real life — a long stability, or a brief moment of undeniable connection?

There’s a line here (often paraphrased as “one moment of bliss is enough for a whole life”) that can sound naïve if you read it cynically. But I think it’s a kind of hard-won self-protection: he’s trying to prevent bitterness from rewriting the only sincere happiness he’s been offered.

My read: this page is where the dreamer finally does something that isn’t a fantasy — he blesses someone else’s future even when it excludes him. It’s painful, but it’s also the most adult act in the entire story: choosing gratitude over possession.
