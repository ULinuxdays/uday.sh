# p. 17 — The Contract of Friendship

**Page reference:** p. 17

On this page, the narrator and Nastenka effectively negotiate the terms of their relationship. It reads almost like a contract: what can be said, what can be hoped for, what kind of closeness is allowed.

The interesting part is how *formal* the tenderness is. Their rules don’t reduce intimacy — they create a safe container for it. The narrator can finally act (walk with someone, speak honestly) without spiraling into fantasy, because the boundaries keep the imagination from taking over.

But there’s also an ache hiding inside the politeness: he’s grateful for any role that places him near her life, even if that role is “just” a friend. This is a page where you can feel the story’s moral pressure: can you be truly generous while you’re also quietly hoping the rules will change?
