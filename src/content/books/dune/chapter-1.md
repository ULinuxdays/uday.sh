# p. 4 — The Dreamer’s City

**Page reference:** p. 4

The narrator isn’t just *in* St. Petersburg — he treats it like a living companion. The streets become a place where he can be “social” without the risks of actual social contact: the city doesn’t ask him to explain himself, reject him, or demand reciprocity.

What stands out on this page is how quickly the story frames loneliness as a practiced skill. He’s not merely isolated; he’s *adapted*. The “dreamer” identity is almost a profession: he takes ordinary sights and turns them into an interior world where he has control.

My read: Dostoevsky sets up a tension that will run through the whole piece — the narrator is sensitive and observant, but that sensitivity is also a shield. The city is the first thing he can love safely because it can’t love him back in any messy, complicated way.

A beginning is the time for taking the most delicate care that the balances are correct. This every sister of the Bene Gesserit knows. To begin your study of the life of Muad'Dib, then, take care that you first place him in his time: born in the 57th year of the Padishah Emperor, Shaddam IV. And take the most special care that you locate him in his place: the planet Arrakis. Do not be deceived by the fact that he was born on Caladan and lived his first fifteen years there. Arrakis, the planet known as Dune, is forever his place.

Also, the old woman came. She was the Reverend Mother Gaius Helen Mohiam.

"Put your hand in the box," she said to Paul.

"What's in the box?"

"Pain."
